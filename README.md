# Library Management System

Welcome to the **Library Management System** project! This project is a web-based application designed to help manage books and users in a library. The application allows users to add new books, borrow books, and return them with ease.

## Features

- **Add Book**: Admins can add new books to the library, including the book's name, picture, and the number of copies available.
- **Borrow Book**: Users can borrow books, which decreases the number of available copies. The system also alerts users when no copies are available.
- **Return Book**: Users can return books, which updates the number of available copies.
- **Add Person**: Admins can add new users to the library system.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET MVC**: Backend framework used for building the web application.
- **Bootstrap**: Frontend framework for responsive design.
- **jQuery**: Used for interactive features and DOM manipulation.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons and visual enhancements.
- **GitHub Pages**: For deployment.
